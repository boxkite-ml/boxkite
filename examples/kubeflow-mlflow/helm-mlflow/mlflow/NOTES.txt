Now you can access MLFlow's UI via your service/ingress address.

You can also point MLFlow tracking to the remote MLFlow server exporting:

export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=https://mlflow.example.org

...and running an mlflow experiment.


See https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html for more information.
